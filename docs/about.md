## What you'll need

If this is your first time in the water, don’t worry about having to buy all the kit beforehand. We have a variety of crafts for you to try out and you can borrow our buoyancy aids, paddles and helmets. Kayaks and canoes are expensive so it is best to try a few out before deciding if you want to buy one.

We recommend that you turn up at least 15-20 minutes before the session starts to allow the coaches to get you set up with suitable equipment.

You don’t need to have a wetsuit, but please wear clothing that you are happy to get wet. If the weather is bad there are a number of waterproofs you can borrow from the club. For footwear either beach shoes, sandals or soft-soled trainers. Again, expect these to get a bit wet.

Please [contact](/docs/contact) us via email or Facebook with the date you would like to come down and have a paddle. Due to a recent fire we no longer keep kit on site. No kayak fits all so we will need some basic stats such as height, weight, size and ability so we can match a kayak to your requirements.
